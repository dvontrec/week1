# Week 3

Javascript ... What/Where/Why Ajax

## What
AJAX is short for Asynchronous Javascript And XML

## Where
AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. 

## Why
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

This makes no sense without an example. Lets create a small project that
generates profile information for fake people.
